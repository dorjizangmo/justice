    <p>Justice has good benefits:</p>

    <ol>
     <li>provides equality</li>

     Even though Justice is imperfect we have to use the correct one to prevent injustice.
     The way my website is going to prevent injustice is by:</p>
     <ol>
       <li>putting awareness that injustice is bad.</li>
       <li>Putting information of the types of Justice/Injustice so that we can find the correct type of justice.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If there are any problems with my website or my view please let me know.</p>
